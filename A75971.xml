            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He richeſt Crown, and highest glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a people, is to be Gods Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, related in Covenant-nearneſs to him, dedicated to his Praiſe, truſted with his Word, the only perfect Rule, guided in the alone way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the true Religion; Religion ſhining in thoſe greater Beauties of Purity, Power, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (ſtill that Purity being preſerved moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, the Power held up eminently, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity maintained entirely) and to have all due provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made for this Crown, and Glory to deſcend, and ſettle upon Poſterity for ever.</p>
            <p>To conſider how much of the fore-mentioned Glory hath dwelt in our Land, together with its gradual declining, great decay, almoſt departing; the hopes of Reformation given, and heightned, but ſoon diſappointed, ſadly turned into fears, confuſions, and ſuch vaſt evils, which once let
<pb facs="tcp:118930:3"/>in, have been ſo lengthened out: Above all, to ſeriouſly view our preſent condition; of ſin, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſoareſt ſmartings, more abounding it ſpreads farther, roots deeper, riſes higher, but comes dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nearer to a filling up; Of miſeries, in complicate diſtempers, imminent dangers, and ſo extreme difficulty of healing, ſettlement and ſecurity, our hearts cannot but break and bleed within us; To ſee Souls more precious than Worlds (whoſe price can never fall lower) to run unwonted higher hazards of utter undoing. The numbers among us either more ſetled in ignorance, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in prophaneneſs, fixed in meer civility and formality, without any Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or arrived at very Neutrality; and not a few (which we tremble to mention) under fearful Apoſtacy of damnable Hereſies, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest practiſes, often alſo attended with helliſh blaſphemies. Theſe Souls, all retaining their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable worth, and for ought can be known, poſſibility of ſaving, ſhould they not have all endeavour of pulling them out of the fire; and if by Covenant-Obligation, and Sacramental-Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they are Chriſts Propriety and Right; ſhould not his Officers and Stewards ſtrive to the utmoſt to recover them to the King of Glories
<pb facs="tcp:118930:3"/>uſe and ſervice? yet theſe poor periſhing ones, as to any effectual order for Inſtruction or Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, remain helpleſs.</p>
            <p>Ah! that we could not go higher to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and diſſecurities of Religion it ſelf, in thoſe checks given to the progreſs, damps to the Power, wide breaches made in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and most daring attempts againſt the very Being and Reality; almost no Doctrine or practiſe eſcaping vain doubting, yea impious vilifying and decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Add that further danger of Opportunity and Temptation, either of ſhifting wayes and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till the ſubſtance and foundation is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, or for to ſhake off profeſſion of Godlineſs, ſhut out the Knowledge, and ſit at home at doing nothing.</p>
            <p>Beſides (which ſtill more endangers) many of the elder ſort, (who ſhould derive Religion to ſucceeding Times) by ſinful indifferency, are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to let go their hold of the Truth; and moſt of the younger, either diſtracted at diverſities of Wayes and Opinions, or diſacquainted with the very principles of Chriſtianity, are never like to take ſure hold of it.</p>
            <p>Oh that we had not to bewail the diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diviſions, diſtances, and oppoſitions, among
<pb facs="tcp:118930:4"/>Brethren of the ſame houſhold of Faith; and theſe ariſing chiefly from leſs and lower points and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctillioes, when in fundamentals, and the main, there is ſo great an accord. And to all we annex, the offence given the weak, diſcouragements to commers in to godlineſs, juſt ſcandal to many at home, and in Forraign Nations, opening wide the mouths, and ſtrengthening the hands of Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries againſt us; and the moſt (if not all theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils) ariſing chiefly from our uneſtabliſhment, as to Scripture and Goſpel-Order.</p>
            <p>Therefore when Souls are thus periſhing, Truth lies bleeding, diviſions continuing, enemies inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, dangers and difficulties not abating, and (which far tranſcends all that can be ſaid) the most precious and glorious Name of Chriſt ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſuffering: All this likewiſe, when our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous condition is not utterly hopeleſs, but like the patient languiſhing, not from utter defect of remedy, but want of the Phyſitians willingneſs to joyn together, ſtudy the caſe, and apply the cure, For theſe things our hearts melt, and eyes mourn, till the Lord look down from heaven and help: But when all looking, bewailing, pities and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can little avail, without endeavours of redreſs in a right way firſt reſolved, and then unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:118930:4"/>carried on, for which the conceived expedient, is a Brotherly Aſſociation, long ſince in our thoughts, and already begun by others, godly learned, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Counties; others of different judgement, in point of Church-Government, ſhewing the hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hindred <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, to ariſe, not ſo much from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of principles, inconſiſtent with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, as from defect of will and inclination, and this from a grand failing in Brotherly Love.</p>
            <p>Therefore laying aſide all private reſpects, and carnal intereſts, and reſigning our ſelves wholly up to the Lord, we reſolve in his ſtrength, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what we have attained, to unite together for carrying on the work of Reformation, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our duties, in our reſpective places: and not only an Aſſociating in this particular County, but correſpondency with our Brethren in other parts of the Nation, yet hereby, not binding up, and limiting our ſelves from further improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, which we hope the Lord will teach and ſtabliſh in his time <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally.</p>
            <p>And for an Introductive to the work in hand, and freeing our ſelves from imputed Innovation in the Doctrine of Religion, we declare, that as all way formerly we have owned; ſo we do, (and by Chriſts aſſiſtance) will ever own, and maintain the
<pb facs="tcp:118930:5"/>form of wholeſome words, contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of the Old and New Teſtament, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly received ſenſe of the Orthodox Churches of Chriſt, expreſt more eſpecially (as to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Faith) in that moſt Ancient and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received Creed, called the Apoſtles, in the therewith agreeing famous <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and that notable Creed of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> to which (we might add thoſe excellent Creeds of the Great Councils of <hi>Conſtantinople, Epheſus, Calcedon,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,) likewiſe we declare our owning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to own and maintain, the whole Body of Proteſtant Reformed Doctrine, ſo far as it is joyntly held forth in their Confeſſions of Faith, and in our Engliſh Articles, the Articles of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, 1615.</hi> And in the late Confeſſion of Faith, by the Aſſembly of Divines, ſo fully and excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth; and having it, (as to the matter it ſelf) long ſince impreſt on our thoughts, which ſome pious and prudent Brethren have publiſhed for the Baſis &amp; ground of their Aſſociating work, we think it no diminution, but honour (if not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to tread in their exemplary Chriſtian, and peaceable ſteps, ſhewing our ready concurrence with them in building on the ſame Foundations, which are theſe enſuing Rules.</p>

               <p n="2">2. We agree, that every one who profeſſeth Faith in Chriſt, and hopes for Salvation by him, ought to joyn himſelf as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſome one or other Viſible Church, where the Word of God is truly preached, and the Sacraments are duly adminiſtred; and that it is moſt agreeable to order and edification for thoſe that dwell together in one place, to joyn together as Members of the ſame particular Church; and that a peoples meeting together or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, to attend upon the publike worſhip in one place, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting themſelves to the Ordinances of Chriſt therein diſpenced, is a real expreſſion of their conſent &amp; agreement, to joyn as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to that Church: Yet becauſe we conceive the more expreſs this Agreement and Conſent is, the more fully it puts us in mind of our mutual relation, and ſtirs us up the more to the performance of our reſpective duties to each other; therefore we have hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to annexed a profeſſion of Aſſent to the Fundamentals of Faith, by way of Explication of the Creed, called the Apoſtles (which we all own, and will maintain.) Likewiſe a profeſſion of Conſent to the tearms of the Covenant of Grace, (which alſo we all freely agree unto) and both theſe, we conceive, may not unfitly be uſed (if not in the expreſs words,) yet at leaſt as to the ſubſtance of them) either at the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or on other occaſions, as prudence ſhall direct.</p>

               <p n="7">7. But for the more full enumeration of ſcandals, we agree to refer it to determination in our Meetings of Aſſociation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We agree, not to admit to the Ordinance any ſuch, who are not only guilty of the fore-mentioned ſcandals, but of any other evil of like nature and quality, until they have given ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their repentance, which muſt not be ſlight, and meerly verbal, but ſerious, ſo far as may be judged by us.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We reſolve to uſe great caution, concerning ſins that make men lyable to the Law, as to their lives, liberties, eſtates, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe not provided for in this Agreement.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We reſolve not to admit any to the Sacrament, but ſuch a one that hath been firſt declared to thoſe with whom he is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, that if any of them can object, and prove duly any thing againſt him, whereby he appears unfit to receive, that party may be kept from the Ordinance, till the Church or Congregation receive ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="11">11. We agree to require of all Governours of Families, that come to this Ordinance, to bring and keep their families under Catechizing, and to ſee they learn and underſtand the Principles of Chriſtianity; and if they cannot inſtruct them themſelves, to bring them to us to be inſtructed.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If any perſon that hath been admitted to the Lords Supper, ſhall at any time hereafter prove ſcandalous in Concerſation, we will not receive ſuch a one to the Sacrament, till he teſtifie Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſatisfie the Church.</p>
               <p n="13">13. We reſolve to take notice of ſuch, who formerly have been admitted to the Lords Supper, and abſent themſelves from it, and to enquire into the reaſons of their abſence, and accord. ingly we will deal with them as we find juſt cauſe, that neither Chriſts Ordinances may ſeem to be deſpiſed, nor opportunity of doing good to their own ſouls neglected.</p>
               <p n="14">14. We agree, to be very cautious of admitting ſuch of other Congregations, that occaſionally offer themſelves to receive the Lords Supper with any of us, that ſo no juſt offence may be given thereby, either to godly Miniſters, or Congregations from which they come, neither to our own people that joyn with us in that Ordinance.</p>

               <p n="15">15. We agree, not to admit any to this Sacrament, that are members of other Congregations, without either a Teſtimonial from their Miniſter of their orderly walking, or that we can be aſſured both of their fitneſs for the Ordinance, and their not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the fellowſhip of that Congregation, whereof they be Members.</p>
               <p n="16">16. We agree, when in any of our Congregations, ſuch as are rightly qualified for receiving the Lords Supper, ſhall be ſo few, as not to make up any competent number to joyn together in that Ordinance; we will then adviſe with the Aſſociation concerning the beſt expediency, as to uniting with ſome other Congregation, for that preſent neceſſity, yet only until that impediment ſhall be removed.</p>

               <head>Government in particular.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHereas we all agree, that every Miniſter of Chriſt is made by him a Ruler in that Congregation, or Church to which he is called: And many of us think according to Scripture, and the way of divers Reformed Churches, there ſhould be ſome adjoyned to aſſiſt him in Government, called, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders: Yet divers of us alſo are diſſatisfied, as touching ſuch Elders, but all of us alſo conceive it meet, and a Miniſters Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to ſee with more eyes than his own, and have the beſt help he can, both to acquaint him with the Converſation of his people, and to aſſiſt him in matters of concernment, that cannot ſo ſafely or conveniently be done by himſelf alone: Therefore we agree (as we ſhall ſee it feiſable and fit, in reſpect of our people,) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the aſſiſtance of ſome godly and diſcreet perſons of our reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Congregations, both for the acquainting us with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of our people, and to be preſent ſometimes at leaſt with us as witneſſes of our due, and equal proceeding, both in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch as offer themſelves to the Lords Supper: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in caſe of ſome admonitions to be given to offenſive walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; yet it ſhall be no hindrance to the work of Union, for any of us to do, as he is beſt perſwaded in his own judgement, and may more conduce to peace and Edification.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:118930:12"/>
               <p n="2">2. We agree, that for the Exerciſe of Government in our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations, it is to be managed by thoſe that rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in the Lord, and that therefore the Examination and Determination of things, in point of admiſſions to Ordinances, and refuſals, together, with other Church acts, ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and mannaged by them; yet not without notice given to the people, of what in matters of general concernment and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is determined by them; that if any can upon grounds out of the Word object any thing, their ſatisfaction may be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, or the matter forborn.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In theſe, and all ſuch caſes, wherewith the people are made acquainted, we agree, according to Scripture Rules, practice of the Churches, and all Societies rightly ordered, there muſt be one to govern the matter of ſpeech, and ſilence, of which the Paſtour or Miniſter is to take care that order be maintained.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We agree, that to heal offences, and remove ſcandals out of the Church, Chriſt hath provided the remedy of admonition of offenders, and other Church cenſures, to which there ought to be no proceeding, but in caſe of known offence, and ſuch as cannot be healed without cenſure; and offences, being ſome of them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, others publike, they require a proceeding according to their nature and quality.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In private offences, or ſcandals of one Brother againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, known if to more than the brother, yet but to few, we agree, that as Chriſtian Inſpection, and watchfulneſs over each other, muſt not degenerate into imprudent, raſh, and uncharitable prying into others failings, ſo Brotherly Admonition may not at any time become unadviſed, and unwarrantable medling; therefore we are in proceedings of this ſort to follow, as other Scripture Rules, ſo eſpcially that Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. <hi>If thy Brother,</hi> &amp;c. which offence or treſpaſs we underſtand, not to be meant by our Lord, of ſuch humane infirmities, that all men, even the beſt Saints on earth, in this ſtate of imperfection, continually fall into; nor of ſuch ſmaller faults or injuries, which Chriſtian prudence, love, and peaceableneſs, require an over-looking and paſſing by, but the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence there grounding the admonition is a greater evil, endangering the ſoul of the doer, ſcandalizing the Brother ſeeing it, and lying as a ſtumbling ſtone in his Chriſtian courſe, and ſuch a ſin, that for the nature of it, is fit, in caſe of inſucceſſefulneſs of admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be brought before the Church.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:118930:12"/>
               <p n="6">6. Beſides this Eccleſiaſtical Admonition, we yeeld there may be other Charitative Admonitions, which muſt not proceed to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical cenſure.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Therefore for our own particulars, we ſhall be very tender and cautious, what either we our ſelves do, or encourage others unto in this caſe, but on ſuch grounds as the Word will ſufficiently warrant.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The offence or ſcandal againſt a Brother, being more than a meer humane infirmity; the offending <hi>Brother,</hi> by the Rule of Chriſt, ought to go to his <hi>Brother</hi> offended, and declare his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to him, who thereupon is to forgive him; but if the Offender neglect that duty, the <hi>Brother</hi> offended, is to go perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to him, and tell him his fault between themſelves alone; and if by that admonition the offence be healed, and the Brother gained, it is to be concealed for the future.</p>
               <p>If he hear not this firſt admonition, the party offended is to take to him two or three witneſſes, and if he then hear at the ſecond admonition before witneſſes, the matter ought to be kept ſecret by both the Admoniſher, and the Witneſſes; but if he again hear not before Witneſſes, then the matter is to be told to the Church, which though ſome underſtand of Church Rulers, others of the Church of a particular Congregation, yet all do agree, that for order and decency, the accuſation muſt not firſt be brought to the whole Congregation, but to the Rulers, or Over-ſeers; and therefore we reſolve not to countenance the bringing of any ſuch matter before the Congregation, till thoſe that are ſet over them in the Lord, have firſt been acquainted with it, to whom belongs alſo the giving of all publike admonitions; if afterward the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid party upon proof of ſin be admoniſhed by the Church, and he hear not the Church, but is obſtinate in the ſin, then he ought to be accounted as an Heathen man, and a Publican; and excluded the Church.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Publike Scandal.</head>
               <p n="1">1. VVE agree, that a private Scandal, by obſtinacy added to it againſt private admonition, and thereupon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118930:13"/>told, and proved to the Church, eſpecially by that further obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt the Churches following admonition, becomes a publike ſcandal; but properly a publike ſcandal, is that which in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the very firſt is publike and notorious, known to many, if not to the whole Church, in which caſe the former proceeding by a private gradual admonition, is not requiſite nor proper; but the Church, when an offence is thus publike, ought immediatly to deal with it according to the nature of the offence, either by the leſs cenſure of admonition, when the Scandal is leſs, which admonition may be once, or oftner, as need ſhall require, or by the greater Cenſure of Excommunication, when the ſcandal is greater and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, wherein we reſolve faithfully to endeavour the diſcharge of that duty ſhall be incumbent on us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the party offending after due proceeding, ſhall manifeſt Repentance, and ſatisfie the Church, he is to be received into fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the ſatisfaction of the Church is required more evidence of Repentance after ſome greater ſin is committed, or in caſe of relapſing readily into the ſame ſin, for which he hath declared Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance before the Church, or falling into ſome new ſcandalous evil, after a former cenſure, and re-admiſſion into Communion, then in other caſes. Therefore we agree to be very cautious and circumſpect herein, that there be not an over-haſty re-admitting of any ſuch, till due tryal of Reformation be made in ſome compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent meaſure of time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When an offender is under Church-Cenſure, though the former Chriſtian-Fellowſhip be denied to him, yet ought there to be all due wayes uſed to reduce him to Repentance towards God, and former Fellowſhip with the Church, as being a Member or perſon under cure. Therefore we reſolve ſo long as opportunity and hope remain, to do our beſt endeavours (when any Member of our Congregations ſhall come under Cenſure) for the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſuch out of Satans Snare, and reducing them to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt, and his Churches Fellowſhip.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whereas ſuch Members of the Church born and Baptized in it, (by vertue of the Covenant of their Parents, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into it) have many priviledges, which others not Church-Members have not, as their being in Covenant with God, having the Seal of the Covenant of Baptiſme upon them, and ſo if they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118930:13"/>are not Regenerate, yet are in a more hopeful way of attaining Regenerating Graces, and all the ſpiritual bleſſings, both of the Covenant and Seal; and are alſo under Church-watch and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and conſequently ſubject to ſuch Goſpel-order, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to their ſpiritual good: Therefore we agree to endeavour to perform what we judge our duty towards them accordingly, as God ſhall afford us power and opportunity.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BEcauſe we judge it lawful and neceſſary for Members of divers Churches, in ſundry caſes of common concernment, and greater weight, to hold correſpondence and communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we agree to aſſociate our ſelves, and keep frequent meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings together, as occaſion ſhall require.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We agree, that whereas Synods and Councils (wherein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of ſeveral Churches meet for matters of common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and greater importance) may Miniſterially determine and order ſuch things according to the Word of God, ſo their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and orders being conſonant to it, are to be received with reverence and ſubmiſſion, not only for the agreement with the Word, but for the power whereby they are made, as being an Ordinance of God, appointed thereunto in his Word, ſo we judge our ſelves and our Congregations bound to follow whatſoever Advice, Direction, or Admonition (being conſonant to the Word) any of us ſhall receive from the Brethren in their meetings of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation with us.</p>

               <p n="6">6.

            <p>IT will readily be yielded, that the great work of Chriſtians here, is to advance to their utmoſt, the Superlative intereſt of Chriſt his Kingdome and Glory. That the way conducing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto lies; Firſt, (for a ſure foundation) to begin with a Totall and free ſubjecting themſelves to Chriſt: Then for ſuller furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to endeavour after the largeſt Heart, and moſt publike Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for doing very much for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And (as a yet more full and proportionate meanes,) to put themſelves into the beſt poſture of the fulleſt and firmeſt Union and Conjunction, for exalting together of the Name and Cauſe of Chriſt; without which Generall Union, neither the Churches Edification, Reformation, or Preſervation, can be ſufficiently provided for, as neceſſarily requiring a conjunction of hearts, knit together in Love, of heads united in counſels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, and of hands affording their beſt aſſiſtance and help.</p>
            <p>Among others, there are theſe three things in the reformed Churches, which are the great <hi>Dolenda,</hi> the greatly to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed.</p>
            <list>

               <item>2. That height and depth of hazzard and danger, they daily run by that want of good Union.</item>
               <item>3. That ſo great, ſo great neglect of applying any juſt and proportionate remedy to heal diviſions and prevent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Certainly 'tis no ſmall one, but one of the great ſcarrs ſeen this day in the Face of the Proteſtant Churches, that ſinfull divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and want of Union, which interrupts thoſe good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies and joynt actings thereupon, to the ſecuring and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Proteſtant intereſt, that would upon conjunction fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:118930:22"/>
            <p>Our Lord indeed tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>The Children of this world are wiſer in their generation, then the Children of Light:</hi> and beſides former, our own preſent age and experience, do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly prove and ſeale unto it.</p>
            <p>Divers adverſe parties, though ſmaller, they can hit it, they can be cloſely united among themſelves, and ſtrongly combined againſt the reformed; But Papiſts, (the greateſt enemies, and the greateſt party) are the moſt eminently and obſervedly prudent and wiſe (as to matter of Union, and combination againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.)</p>
            <p>They (though ſo ſcattered over the earth, as to places of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;) yet are all one in heart, for to unite ſtill ſtrongly againſt the Proteſtants. And for a ſpring and feeder of all their affairs and dangerous actings, they have one chief (the deepeſt and moſt impenetrable) counſel; They have the choiceſt inſtruments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt correſpondencies, ſureſt intelligences, and the moſt equall and unwearied proſecutions of their grand deſign, the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of their own, and extirpating of the reformed party and way.</p>
            <p>But the Proteſtants (though for numbers no whit deſpicable, and by good conjunction would be ſuſſiciently formidable) are ſo defective towards themſelves, as they neither do, nor will piece together in any entire and generall Union, for Counſels, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies, and joynt proſecution of their own <hi>intereſt and preſervation.</hi> And as this <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and inconſiſtency, becomes a daily deriſion and reproach among their adverſaries, and makes them look upon the Proteſtants, as a very ſimple party, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wiſdome of ſelf-preſervation by union; So it is the great ground given them, to place their deſtructive Engines, carry on their mines, and lay their trains.</p>
            <p>But for any juſt and ſpeedy remedy as yet undertaken effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, This is rather the Object of our Deſires, Prayers, and Tears, then of our Hopes: and not to be expected untill God rebuke that ſpirit of diviſion (gone out among the Churches) breathe a Spirit of Love and Unity, and bow the claſhing intereſts of States and Kingdoms, into a due ſubſerviency to that Supream intereſt of the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When therefore diſunion and diviſion is ſo great a ſcarr in the face of the Churches in generall, It can be no ſmall blemiſh in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118930:23"/>particular Nations and Churches: but is more eſpecially ſo, in this Nation of ours.</p>
            <p>That ſo many Nations divided in ſituation, and of ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Languages and intereſts, more eſpecially, do not ſo perfectly unite, is not altogether ſo ſtrange: But for thoſe of our Nation, (and which formerly were ſo united,) to be ſo rent and torn in pieces, and ſo remain without a healing up into unity; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the great and growing diviſions among us, to hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſcorns and deriſions of the adverſaries: to foreſee that danger that heightens, and the ruine that haſtens towards us, by our enemies cloſe conjunctions, deep contrivances, and daily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of ſo many Parties, eſpecially the Popiſh, who are both greatly encreaſed and encouraged, to act and ſtrive with all their artifices and induſtries to make our diviſions ſubſervient to their own deſtructive purpoſes againſt us: And, which adds no little weight to all the former, for our ſelves to find it, and our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries thereby to obſerve, their great advantages by that great defect of any adequate meanes yet uſed; yea, and withall, ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall a heartleſneſs unto any ſuch way, which may timely ſecure and relieve us,</p>
            <q>
               <l>— Pudet haec opprobria nobis,</l>
               <l>Et dici potuiſſe &amp; non potuiſſe refelli.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This is and muſt be for a <hi>Lamentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When therefore our diſtempers and dangers are from diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The remedy muſt needs be by a juſt and generall Union, eſpecially of the conſcientious and godly of different perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>There are three wayes may be thought of for effecting U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that, which though it may greatly be feared, yet cannot juſtly be deſired, and that is the Storme and Flame of Perſecution, to drive and warm us into a willingneſs to unite. This, although perſecution ſometimes hath brought about; yet now if perſecution ſhould ariſe, it muſt in moſt probability be from the Popiſh party, which is no way likely to occaſion it. For now the way of the Papiſts, is not that of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, by a juridical Triall, condemnation and execution, by burnings,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118930:23"/>and ſuch like: But by ſuddain Maſſacres and expoſing to cold, nakedneſs, hunger, and all extremities.</p>
            <p>This is the new way of the Papiſts, a proof of which we have in thoſe three ſucceſſive Inſtances, Firſt, in that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then divers years after, in that of <hi>Poland,</hi> and that of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> Theſe tell us plainly, what courſe they will run, if once oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity be given them. Then when the ſword and violence hath taken away thoſe that come to their hand; The inquiſition will come to find out others that have eſcaped and are undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered</p>
            <p>Therefore if the Popiſh party ſo encreaſe and are ſo buſie dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as on very good grounds it is apprehended) there is great need of a preſent, firm, generall Union, to counterwork them: and the Lord ſet this home on the heedleſs and liſtleſs Spirits in this Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond way for procuring Union, is by the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Interpoſition, by ſetling ſuch order and government as may gather and glue together, the broken and divided parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. But this way though it is not deſired at all by divers, who like no impoſition, but a liberty to do as they pleaſe, yet if the civill power would pleaſe to give their aſſiſtance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement unto it; how ſoon might a happy Union be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the building of Gods Houſe would bring a bleſſing, and greatly conduce to ſettle their own affairs. But when a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is mortall and high, the remedy muſt not be remote and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed: if at preſent this will not be done, we had need do that we can do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a third way, (The way at preſent to effect a good and neceſſary Union) which is by our own free choice or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conjunction and aſſociation, in ſome juſt and moderate way, reſpectively to the godly and peaceable of different perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Continuance of diſunion and every ones going his own way, as the beſt way of peace and preſervation, cannot nor will not in the concluſion, be a relief and remedy to out diſtempers and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Whatſoever may be ſaid for a neceſſity of indulgence, the good party in the Nation muſt come in to ſome fit Union and accord. For ſuch as conceive diſ-union and diviſion beſt,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118930:24"/>we may as ſoon credit them, as we would agree to him, who ſhould affirm, that burnt tow is beſt to make Cord-age, or Roes of ſand are fitteſt to make Cables for Ships that toſs at Sea.</p>
            <p>Or to ſay we need do no more then either lie ſtill, or only act in our own private capacities, in our own particular places, this will avail us little.</p>
            <p>For if the Ship be ſinking, and ſo all engaged to endeavour the ſaving of it, it is no time for any particular perſon to lie ſleeping like <hi>Jonas</hi> in the ſides of the Ship; or to be buſie in his private Cabbin to order his own affairs.</p>
            <p>If a Country be invaded with an Army, it is not fit for the Inhabitants to run into holes and hide themſelves, as the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> did, when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were up againſt them. Neither is that enough in this caſe, for every man to take up Armes, and then ſtand in his own door only; that may help againſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the thief, but not againſt an enemy in a Body. But as the enemies ſtrength and the Countryes danger is by that of many ſingle perſons joyned in one Army; ſo the ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the endangered Country muſt unite (as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> did in that invaſion by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi>) there muſt be Army againſt Army for the preſent ſecurity. The way left us at preſent is Union, by a free and voluntary aſſociating, both to heal Diviſions, and defend our ſelves againſt them that are all united, and joyntly acting againſt the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>But this muſt be a good and a juſt, an entire and extenſive full union; ſo as the Remedy be not below, or ſhort any way of the Malady.</p>
            <p>A good union by the Good, Good men ſincerely and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cloſing for carrying on the work.</p>
            <p>A due and entire union made by perſons of a ſutable due Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel temper, of Sobriety, Moderation and Diſcretion, that may thereby evenly joyne and glue together.</p>
            <p>Rigidneſs and Harſhneſs of ſpirit will not ſuit this work; as churliſh Iron, and ſoft pliant Gold, will not agree in a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious frame, for an exquiſite and continuing motion: Nor harſher matter, with ſofter ſilk in the ſame piece; which will
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118930:24"/>not wear or hold well, but ſoon fret out: Goſpel calmneſs and gentleneſs, Humility and Yieldingneſs muſt make a due union.</p>
            <p>But yet there is need alſo of Reſolution, firmneſs of purpoſe, Confidence and Courage, to make the ſtrong ſoder of a firm and laſting union.</p>
            <p>Men muſt not be of a dubious Heſitancy, of a ſuſpicious timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temper, full of Doubts, Jealouſies, endleſs Diſſatiſfactions, and continuall Unevenneſſes: but <hi>Fortes &amp; Tenaces propoſiti:]</hi> that know firſt what they do, and then fix and hold up in evenneſs and equalities. For when the Remedy is proper, it muſt alſo be conſtantly uſed, ſo long as Neceſſity calls.</p>
            <p>The perſons concerned, that ſhould contribute to, and concurre in this union, are both Miniſters and people.</p>
            <p>Miniſters leading, and people willingly following, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether coming in to help cloſe up the breach, which the high-ſeas and ſpring tides of Diſtempers have made upon us. Firſt, Miniſters of the Goſpel, the Goſpel of peace and union; Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that are publike perſons, and more peculiatly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſhould ſpecially be healers of Breaches in Churches, and among the people of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>They are by Office Guides and Leaders. Firſt, To lead, by preaching Chriſtians into union, ſhewing the Goſpel-duty, the Neceſſity, Excellency, and Utility; To ſet home all Goſpel Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and Inducements upon the Conſciences and Hearts of Chriſtians, and do all they can to light, warm and winne them to it.</p>
            <p>And they are likewiſe to guide and leade by example, Give the faireſt Copie, Set the moſt excellent preſident of endeavours, Induſtry, and Zeal for godly unity. If Miniſters leade not, will their people begin alone? If they are liſtleſs, will people be lively and active? If they are of a low narrow cold cowardly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, will people in probability be of an high heroical zealous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? No, the Miniſters Light muſt help to direct, their Heat to warm, their Reſolution and Zeal to help others to be reſolute and zealous.</p>
            <p>And people alſo ſhould deſign and endeavour union, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118930:25"/>and go along with their godly Miniſters in good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary wayes, Not neglect their Miniſters herein to let them go and act alone: but honour them with yieldings to, and followings of them in what they follow Chirſt.</p>
            <p>Formerly what a ſpirit of willingneſs was there to hear, learn, believe, and do as their godly Miniſters guided and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded? What a Goſpel yieldingneſs and great ſequaciouſneſs was ſeen among people, that turned greatly to their own Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the great Comfort, and high encouragement of their godly Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Chriſts Miniſters they have ever been Satans great eye-ſoar and ſpeciall envy, and Satan hath ever endeavoured to make their credit run as low as he could, that the Goſpel might run the lower, and be glorified the leſs in peoples hearts. A man is ſo far paſſable with others, as he hath eſteem and credit in their hearts, and will accordingly prevail with them. It is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans grand deſign, to make the Reputation of the Miniſters of Chriſt run low, that thereby the Doctrine they bring, might be little regarded.</p>
            <p>Gods deſign in Scripture, and Chriſts great drift in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is to ſet up the Miniſters very high in peoples hearts; (that they ſhould have them in ſingular Honour for their work ſake) knowing this would exalt both his Word, and himſelf alſo. But this hath been Satans deſign, and effected more of late then ever, ſince the Reformation; yea other Ages: ſcarce any have exceeded ours. But the loſs is leaſt to Miniſters, and moſt to the Hearts, that ſuffer themſelves to be prejudiced againſt them. The Word loſes its efficacy, but the people the profit, and their ſouls into the bargain alſo, if they look not to it. But as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt muſt leade, and let their Light ſhine before their people; ſo people muſt let in their light, and ſuffer themſelves to be guided and perſwaded, as for their own Edification, ſo Miniſters great encouragement and comfort. Thus in this great work of Union, both ſhould help and encourage each other, and then the Adverſaries may be diſappointed, and in time our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions healed up.</p>
            <p>Some looking into the obſtacles, likely to hinder Union, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe of different judgements gave (ſome years ſince)
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118930:25"/>among others) a matter of ten Reaſons; which though not in the ſame method, nor in all the words at length, yet is thought not amiſs to mention here.</p>
            <p>As 1. Some place too much of their Religion in ſtanding off from others, as if the height of a Chriſtian lay in rigid Separation from thoſe that are of a lower ſize; and will be hardly drawn to remit any thing of their ſuppoſed neceſſary ſtrictneſs; rather deſiring to pleaſe themſelves, than bear with the weak, ſuſpecting even neceſſary proviſions for admiſſion of the weak, as ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring too much of looſneſſe, and that which may bring on their partaking in other mens ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some have drunk in ſuch prejudice againſt their Brethren, that fancying the difference greater then it is, and ſuppoſing a Cloſure unlawful or ſcarce poſſible, are the more backward to any thing tending to a compoſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Ignorance may prove a great hinderance, many underſtand only the practick part of their own way, not fully knowing the extent neceſſity, indifferency of their ſeverall principles, theſe out of a zeal to truth will ſtand off, as not knowing how far they may yield.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some delight in contentions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some once embittered their blood is not eaſily cooled.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some are pleaſed with nothing that themſelves propound not</p>
            <p n="7">7. Many are engaged and will find it a hard task to deny themſelves in point of honour and credit, which they think will be loſt if they alter their courſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Many are ſo overdriven by their friends, and members of their Congregations, that they dare do little for fear of diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Some want publick principles having but one thing in their eye as ſuppoſe purity or peace, proſecute that to ruine or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of other neceſſary things.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Some want publick Spirits, not caring what become of other Chriſtian, ſo long as they have the Ball at their own foot, or things go with them as they would have it.</p>
            <p>Now as the proper cure and relief of Diviſions, and dangers thence ariſing, muſt neceſſarily be from Union, a ſuitable and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118930:26"/>ſpeedy Union, anſwerable to the nature and extent of the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: ſo that muſt firſt be removed that is the impediment to it, that (though many things elſe concur) is chiefly a great defect of publickneſſe of Spirit, a Spirit carried out to the publick good of the Church of Chriſt and his Cauſe, together with a grand failing in Brotherly Love.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That defect and great want of a publick ſpirit (a ſpirit that hath made ſo many Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Saints in all ages to ſhine ſo gloriouſly.)</p>
            <p>All Chriſtians whatſoever ſhould endeavour great pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickneſſe of Spirit, ſhould put on and wear this rare Jewel, with the rich Pendants of it of pureſt and greateſt aims, beſt contrivances, warmeſt affections, ſtrongeſt higheſt reſolutions for the Churches good, againſt all things whatſoever that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>But publick Perſons, Miniſters, principally they ſhould be of a very eminent and exemplary publickneſſe of Spirit, as they are lights, and leaders, ſo in this, in a more obſerveable manner.</p>
            <p>But now there's none ſhould be of a meer private and impub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but of the moſt publick Spirit.</p>
            <p>We ſhould not be like the Snail that houſes her ſelf in her ſhell, commonly cleaves to a block or ſtone, and ſeldome moves, and then but for a little food.</p>
            <p>But like the Springs of Water, that riſe up, run over, and make a river for general uſe.</p>
            <p>Not like a Light in a dark Lanthorn, which ſhineth only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but like the Heavenly bodies that mounted up, are ſtill running round the Heaven, to carry and convey their light and influence to all. It is too evident that great want of publickneſſe of Spirit, that like an Epidemical common diſeaſe, hath ſpread it ſelf about. This this is the reaſon of that want of endeavours for generall Union.</p>
            <p>The School Maxime is, <hi>Omne negativum fundatur in affirmative,</hi> all disintending and neglect of a duty, ariſes from over intending and following ſomething elſe, that ſhould not be done. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the publick, muſt have ſome ill unworthy ground and occaſion.</p>
            <p>There's ſome evil that infects the Heart of Men, that breeds
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118930:26"/>this <hi>animi deliquium,</hi> this heartleſſneſs unto the publick.</p>
            <p>It was holy <hi>Paul's</hi> complaint in his time, <hi>All ſeek their own, and none the things of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The defect of publickneſſe of Spirit, ſeeking the things of Chriſt, breeds from a private Spirit, and ſinfull ſeeking our own things.</p>
            <p>There is a very private narrow Spirit gone out into the Nation, that like <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> lean and ill favoured Kine, eats up the fat and good.</p>
            <p>Many Chriſtians, many publick perſons, many Miniſters for their own ſafety, eaſe, ſelf-enjoyments, and attendance on their own private affairs, deſign retiredneſs, and pleaſe themſelves in unprofitable Privacies, lying hid, and lying ſtill, withdrawing themſelves from the publick in a great meaſure: when the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick cals ſo loud to all for help.</p>
            <p>There is a very ſinful unworthy Spirit, in divers this way, ſuffering themſelves to be of little uſe, in compariſon of what they might, and hiding much of their Talent in the Napkin of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable privacy.</p>
            <p>This is as if the Springs and Rivers ſhould ſeal up themſelves, or hide themſelves under ground, and bid us go ſeek our water. As if the Sun ſhould ſtand ſtill, draw a Curtain before it and then bid the Moon and Stars to warm the world, and make day.</p>
            <p>Ah how ſinfull is it to be all ſelf, Center-ſelf, and Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſelf, aimes and actings all ſelf; Or to prefer a mans own petty privacies and particularities, before the publick, to have all the heart on the one, no heart on the other, or in an exceeding great diſproportion?</p>
            <p>Never any Chriſtian yet had his licenſe made him, or his <hi>quietus eſt</hi> given him, to retreat from the publick, and lie ſtill in meer unactiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>It is the alone prerogative of him that is immutably ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (and from whom all things only are) to be ſolely for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Weigh it ſeriouſly; there are but two ſorts of Creatures in the world, that have made themſelves a licenſe to be meerly and only for themſelves, and they are Divels, and wicked men, left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118930:27"/>There is nothing in the whole Creation, but as it is ſtampt with a principle of ſelf-preſervation, ſo likewiſe it hath a ſtrong inclination, and will accordingly on occaſion to beſtir it ſelf into a zealous activity to preſerve the univerſe.</p>
            <p>Many heathens though moved only by principles of Morality, yet were often Perſons of a moſt Publick and Heroicall Spirit, eminently carried forth and acted, to undertake and adventure for the publick good.</p>
            <p>Holy perſons in Scripture are purpoſely put upon the file of a glorious Record, for their excellent publick Spirit, their being ſo ſtudious and zealous for promoting the publick, and not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own private, as to eſtates, liberties, lives, or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver might be dear and precious to them; As <hi>Moſes, David, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah, Paul,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>The Saints in Heaven, though ſo ſecure and happy, yet are all of a moſt publick, tranſcendently publick Spirit, engaging for the Church Militant in their requeſts continually.</p>
            <p>The glorious Angels are of this publick Spirit, being daily moſt freely miniſtring Spirits for the good of the Heires of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The moſt Bleſſed God, although he needeth nothing, and is under no obligation to any, but as himſelf pleaſes; yet hath the largeſt heart, and moſt liberall hand, doing good to all, eſpecially his Churches: and guides continually every thing, as to his own glory, ſo the good of his.</p>
            <p>That private Spirit, that deſigning of, and pleaſing it ſelf in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable receſſes, latencies, and lying ſtill: That Spirit which is under a Spirituall Liſtleſneſs, and Cowardize for doing and adventuring any thing to promote or preſerve the publick, is the moſt improper and irregular thing in the world.</p>
            <p>The moſt excellent Chriſtians have the moſt publick, lively Spirits, the greateſt thoughts, higheſt aimes, largeſt affections, moſt abundant Zeal, activity, and equality of endeavours for the publick.</p>
            <p>Theſe when private, narrow, liſtleſs Spirited men, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded their own, will have but a bad account to give in to Chriſt; Theſe will render up their account with greateſt joy and confidence.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:118930:27"/>
            <p>This the firſt great Obſtruction to our healing and relieving Union, want of a publick Spirit, and this from being ſo much of an unprofitable private Spirit, ſet upon, and ſeeking our own, and not the things of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond (and which alſo greatly grounds the former) is that very great want of Love. Firſt, To Jeſus Chriſt his cauſe and Goſpel-Brotherly Love.</p>
            <p>Love, which is excluſive of a meerly private and narrow, of a liſtleſs cold and dull diſtemper, introduces a free and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, active, adventurous, and zealous diſpoſition, and way; and is one of the great Fountains and Feeders of publickneſs of Spirit. One of the great Legacies the Lord Jeſus bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed to his Diſciples, when he was leaving the world, was peace.</p>
            <p>And one of the great Commandments given in charge by him was Brotherly Love, the ground of peace and unity; let that be well conſidered.</p>
            <p>Brotherly Love (which beſides that great weight of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Scepter of Chriſt, lying on it all the Scriptures over, and the clear ſtamps of his authority in thoſe frequencies of ſtricteſt Scripture Precepts,) to make it more paſſable and currant, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt himſelf, a peculiar Stamp and new Signature, and is that alone in all the Scripture, which is ſtiled the new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, required to be the proper Goſpel-badge of Chriſts Diſciples. <hi>Herby ſhall all men,</hi> &amp;c. And Brotherly unity is the genuine and rare fruit of Brotherly Love, by every Chriſtian to be endeavoured to the utmoſt extent of Goſpel poſſibility. Nothing in our own Spirits of corrupt diſtemper, carnal ends or undue prejudice ſhould hinder it; nothing in our Brethren ſound in the Faith, and of Godly Converſation, though not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely agreeing with us in way, diſpoſition, or opinion in all things: Chriſtians cannot be all alike here. All have not the ſame intellectuall complexion. It is a great defect of meekneſs of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to refuſe all agreement with others becauſe they agree not with us in all things. Neither may any other Chriſtian precepts hinder us.</p>
            <p>Ah that we could duly conſider of this new, this one new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, our Lords peculiar charge given upon ground of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118930:28"/>great neceſſity in Goſpel times, foreſeen perfectly by the Lord the all-knowing Law-giver, and King of his Church!</p>
            <p>Certainly when Chriſt will heal and ſtabliſh a people, he fills their Spirits with over-powering Brotherly Love, to ſmooth off heart-unevenneſſes of disinclinations, diſtruſts, and miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and makes them firmly piece together in Godly unity. Love as the Apoſtle hath it, is the bond of perfectneſs. Yea, Love is the fulfilling of the Law, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, That will encline and enable wiſe for, and make willing with it, and conſtrain us into it, into all the latitude of duties we owe to fellow-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and preſerve us therein. Get we but that ſincere and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Love, the Goſpel calls for; and unity will be both eaſily brought about and kept a firm and full unity, that may anſwer the Churches preſent neceſſity. If there be any defect in Union 'tis from a <hi>deficience</hi> in this Bond, this affection of Love. Were there among other Goſpel requiſites this publick Spirit, were this Goſpel Brotherly Love put on, this would recover and reduce us to happy unity, without which the breaches and diſtempers are not likely to be healed.</p>
            <p>For to provoke us (thoſe eſpecially that are the backward and unactive!) oh that we could conſider things together! and once more in Chriſts name be entreated to endeavour it. For is Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Union meerly arbitrary, and left to our liberty, and not of a Scripture and Goſpel neceſſity? Are not diviſions among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians carnall? Are not ſowers of diſcord among Brethren abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Lord?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.3. Prov. 6.12. Rom. 16.17.</note> Muſt not thoſe that make diviſions, be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and alſo avoided?</p>
            <p>Hath not God in Scripture ſtraitly Commanded Unity, Chriſt moſt ſignally, and peculiarly enjoyned it? Do not his Apoſtles very frequently in the New Teſtament, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c.) both require and perſwade to it? yea, muſt we not look to keep it ſtudiouſly, ſolicitouſly, and zealouſly endeavour it? And that, as in other Scriptures, is there urged upon very General and equitable reaſons, that extend to all Chriſtians. There are ſeven ones, and all reſpecting all the People of God, as thoſe <hi>Epheſians.</hi> It is not to be endeavoured only with ſome ſingle perſons, whom we ſhall pleaſe to pick out to our ſelves. Or with thoſe particular Congregations we are fixed in, but with all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118930:28"/>Chriſtians in General, as their condition requires, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is afforded to us? And accordingly, have not good Chriſtians in all Ages, both aſſented to the Doctrine, and earneſtly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the practice of it? Doth not all experience of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Evidence the Neceſſity of it? Did not thoſe Churches ſo excellently conſtituted by the Apoſtles themſelves, ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the uſe and Neceſſity of it, as we ſee in the caſe of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 15. which occaſioned that Application to the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and thereupon the firſt and exemplary Chriſtian Synod, Whereby that , and likewiſe other Churches were eſtabliſhed in the Faith?</p>
            <p>Let matters be never ſo well Conſtituted in Churches, yet there ever will be <hi>New Emergencies,</hi> and after caſes, which will call for, and ſtill Neceſſitate union and correſpondencie, and that cannot be relieved otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>At this day, thoſe Diviſions among the Reformed, are not they acknowledged, and bewailed as ſinfull, and greatly deſired by the Godly, of any moderate ſpirits, of all parties, to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Yea, among our ſelves is it not ſo acknowledged and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed, and accordingly are not our deſires and Prayers, ſtill a going after it? Do we not Evidently ſee the evils, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, that will unavoidably every day encreaſe, and Grow upon us, without Union?</p>
            <p>Ah! What will become of Truth, of all Goſpel-Truths, and the purity of Doctrine, which is preſerved by Union? When the houſe is burnt, and the Gold and Treaſure in it melted, is it not hard finding it among the Rubbiſh? Pearles if they ſhould be buried in great heaps of ſand, will they not hardly be recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? How hard will it be for people to find the Treaſure, the Pearles of Goſpel-Truth, in the Rubbiſh and ſands of multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of errours?</p>
            <p>And what will become of the life and power of Godlineſs, when mens zeale and fervour ſtill evaporate, and breathe forth in contentions; and Chriſtians become engaged to maintain Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, rather then Godlineſs it ſelf?</p>
            <p>Yea, how muſt Ignorance, and Prophaneſs encreaſe, And how will Popery gaine upon us? Yea, and how will that be kept out at laſt; look ſeriouſly to the cloſe. What can Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118930:29"/>and Miniſters do, if unity be not recovered? At the beſt muſt not the Doctrine be highly hazzarded, and hardly be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Muſt not the Power of Godlineſs needs ſink, and be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in theſe Quick-ſands of Diviſion; yea, and withall the civil ſtate? When hearts are divided, and mens wayes and Conſcience ſo continually claſh, and run croſs; muſt not that needs be but in a crazie condition, in compariſon of that, which General union would produce, which alſo would in time, work out a happy ſettlement in the Civil State?</p>
            <p>What though ſome are of the opinion that diſunion is beſt, that makes it not ſo in it ſelf?</p>
            <p>But why ſhould union (the entireſt, fulleſt, and largeſt) union in States, and Kingdoms be beſt; and not in the Church of Chriſt, and among Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>If ſingle perſons or ſmall Townes, and particular places, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry on the Civil Intereſt, without Civil Union, nor never ſufficiently provide for the ſecurity of the Civil State; then why muſt it, or how can it be, that ſingle Chriſtians, or particular Congregations, without Conſociation can carry on, and preſerve Religion in a Nation?</p>
            <p>As all former, ſo late Experience proves, and after Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will ever prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>New England</hi> it ſelf alſo, acknowledges and practices the contrary, and that upon Experience. And they accordingly (even the ſtricteſt of them) do not only wiſh, but encourage, and provoke the Godly of different Judgements in this Nation, to endeavour Unity. And certainly this muſt be very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that they of <hi>New England,</hi> who left this Country for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, and went into a deſolate wilderneſs: They that had ſuch excellent Chriſtians, and Eminent Miniſters, to form and make up their Congregations; They that had ſo full a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to chooſe their own way of Church Government, and withall had ſo great countenance and aſſiſtance from the Civil Magiſtrate, as ever Churches in the world had: yet theſe, theſe ſo accommodated and aſſiſted, after almoſt thirty yeares expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, find a Neceſſity of union of Churches; and of godly Chriſtians, of different Judgement, are in expectation daily of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118930:29"/>it here; blame thoſe that are oppoſite to it, or ſlothfull in it. And certainly this freſh experiment brings a cogent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive Argument, that out-weighs all colours and pretences made by any, for refuſal or neglect of unity. But to adde no more, we our ſelves Generally ſee a Neceſſity of unity, we wiſh it, pray for it, and expect it alſo; but this layes great blame and ſin to our charge, that we do ſo little for it: That our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Prayers concurre in it, but our hands ſtir not, and we do not (to any purpoſe) endeavour after it.</p>
            <p>What then is and muſt be, the Obſtacle to this ſo Neceſſary Unity? Is it private advantage? like men that having a private Trade, are enemies to joynt Stocks and Trading in Companies. Is it liſtleſneſs, and a ſpirit of ſlothfulneſs? like the ſluggard, that will not pull his hands out of his boſom. A lothneſs to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged and taken off our old wonts of unactiveneſs, and doing nothing, but for our own particulars; and ſo being habited and accuſtomed to move, or go no further, we will not diſeaſe our ſelves, and be further engaged. They ſay, as ſpeech, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, wiſdom, or weakneſs; ſo Actions, or not actings, oft diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers cuſtom and habit. If we have contracted an ill cuſtom, of doing nothing or little, except for our ſelves, we had need do the more for after time. 'Tis too true, that meer ſloth and love of eaſe, and lothneſs to do more then that is ordinary, eſpecially that which ſeems New (though never ſo Neceſſary) is one great cauſe of the backwardneſs, and unactiveneſs of many: or is it cowardize, and a timourous temper, an over-cautiouſneſs, and aptitude to ſuſpect every thing, and every man; like the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar that is ſtill ſhrugging the ſhoulder, or like a ſhy Horſe that eats hay in the ſtable, and will ſtartle at a little of it lying in the roade. Shall we alway cry a Lion's in the way, when we ſhould be doing? and ſet up our own apprehenſions, and then ſtartle at them? If theſe be the hinderances, carry we our eye to Primitive Chriſtians, go warm our ſelves into reſolution and activeneſs, at that fire and flame of Heavenly Zeal. How did they adventure to hold tog<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ether in Chriſtian unity, and continuing correſpondency for the firſt three hundred yeares, when the Magiſtrate was not for, but againſt them, yet held Chriſtian union with the hazzard, and oft to the loſs of liberties, Eſtates, and lives, ſo warm was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118930:30"/>their Love, that it caſt out fear, and kept up conſtantly deſire of ſome good unity? And what had become of Religion, and Chriſtianity, if they had been no warmer, and more reſolute and active then many that go for good, are in our times.</p>
            <p>What did the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigences</hi> for divers hundred years, in matter of correſpondency and union, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fury and rage of Perſecution? What was it under Chriſt that kept up Religion in thoſe ſo extreamly corrupt times, but their Conjunctions and Conſtancy?</p>
            <p>What did the Bleſſed Reformers againſt the Pope, Emperour and others, the great difficulties and dangers that preſently aroſe: did they not endeavour Unity and Agreement, notwithſtanding the hazzards, and extremities of thoſe times?</p>
            <p>If the Spirit, and way of Chriſtians in Primitive and ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages, was to labour and adventure for unity, when Laws and the Civil Authority were againſt them; and it was ſo exceeding dangerous? Shall we not adventure and endeavour it, when the Lawes and Civil Power do not hinder us, yea and when of the chief Magiſtrate (to whom this Agreement being preſented) it was not only well accepted, but with ſuch expreſſions alſo of Great Readineſs to countenance, and farther us, in theſe our endeavours after a juſt and moderate union.</p>
            <p>Ah then will any of the fore-named private reſpects, any loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and liſtleſsneſs, fears and jealouſies; will theſe in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary weigh any thing? O will they weigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scripture Commands, Chriſts peculiar New Command, the Judgement and endeavours of the Church, old and new expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, our own as well as others Approbations of Endeavoured for unity, and Prayers for it? Shall we approve it, and pray for it, and then confute our own Conſciences, and ravel out our Prayers, by a ſitting ſtill and looking for an opportunity, as a ripe fruit to fall into our mouthes, and be made to our hands, and not take it when there is ſuch need of it, and likewiſe the way ſo free for it? It is a good ſaying, <hi>Iter ad pietatem eſt intra ipſam pietatem,</hi> It is true of Godly and brotherly unity, the cure of Diviſion and the way of Union is not ſo much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, not wiſhing and deſiring of it; but reſolving, trying, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vigorouſly, and carrying it on with conſtancy. Practice will
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118930:30"/>bring that experience, that will eaſe and ſweeten the way and work, and Evidence that very feiſable, that was lookt on as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, if not impoſſible. And that union is practicable and feiſable, this we ſee by what others, in other parts of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have happily begun and held on. Therefore ſhall we buſie our ſelves in drawing circles in the duſt, as he did when the City was ſtorming, whereby he loſt his life by a common Souldier? Shall we ſit ſtill when Neceſſity calls aloud for it, the way is ſo open to it, and others have ſo fairly led the way before us? If we ſhould do nothing, Union and the work of Chriſt may ariſe and go on another way: But if we be doing, we among others ſhall be called the Repairers of the breach, and our labour ſhall not be in vaine in the Lord; For the Lord will be with them that are with him.</p>
